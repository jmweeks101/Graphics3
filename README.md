# Graphics3
3D graphics package based off John Zelle's grahpics.py package.
We have allowed the user to create spheres, prisms, and pyramids, as well as
allowing them to perform various attribute changes to them (such as fill, zoom, etc.)

# Installation
Use the setup.py file to install the package.
